## Summary 

As per the analysis,we can say that many of the users may not be tourists instead they are work commuters based on the peak time riding analysis. Additionally, majority of the users were male riders based on gender v/s ridiing analsyis .For the Des Moines ride-sharing program, it would be be helpful if the stations were to be set up within 10minutes of biking distance as places tends to be father away in suburbs compared to large cities like NYC.
